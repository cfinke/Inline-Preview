Inline Preview adds a preview of the post you're writing next to the editor when you click Preview (instead of opening it in a new tab).

== Description ==

*Problem:* When creating a post in WordPress, previewing your post in a separate tab can be slow and/or complicated.

*Solution:* Show the preview right next to the editor.

Inline Preview is a plugin for WordPress that adds a zoomed out preview of the current post next to the post editor when the user clicks Preview instead of opening in a new tab.

It's just an idea I'm playing with for streamlining the post creation process, and if it feels familiar, it's probably because it is: through version 2.1, WordPress contained a preview iframe at the bottom of the post editing screen, but this is a more elegant implementation.
